        "\n",
        "1. Train-Test Split: Split the available data into training and test sets. The model is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the test set. This allows assessing how well the model generalizes to unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, to obtain a more robust estimate of the model's performance. Cross-validation involves dividing the data into multiple folds, training and evaluating the model on different combinations of training and validation sets. This helps assess the model's average performance and detect overfitting.\n",
        "\n",

        "6. Feature Selection and Engineering: Perform feature selection to focus on the most informative and relevant features. Eliminate irrelevant or noisy features that may introduce overfitting. Additionally, feature engineering techniques can help extract meaningful information from the data and enhance the model's generalization ability.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Ensemble Methods: Employ ensemble methods, such as bagging, boosting, or stacking, to combine multiple models and improve generalization. Ensemble methods reduce the impact of individual model biases and errors by aggregating predictions from multiple models, leading to improved performance on unseen data.\n",

        "8. Cross-Domain Validation: Validate the model's performance on data from different domains or sources. Evaluating the model's performance on diverse datasets ensures that it can generalize beyond the specific characteristics of the training data. This is particularly important in scenarios where the deployment environment may differ from the training environment.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. Threshold Adjustment: Adjust the classification threshold based on the desired trade-off between precision and recall. A lower threshold can increase the sensitivity to the minority class, but it may also increase the number of false positives. Finding the optimal threshold depends on the specific problem and the associated costs of misclassification.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Evaluation Metrics: Rely on evaluation metrics that are robust to imbalanced datasets. Instead of solely relying on accuracy, consider metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), or receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve that provide a comprehensive understanding of model performance across different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Stratified Sampling: When splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, use stratified sampling to ensure that the class distribution remains similar in both sets. This helps maintain representative samples of all classes in the training and validation datasets.\n",

        "8. Anomaly Detection: Treat the imbalanced dataset as an anomaly detection problem, where the minority class represents the anomalies. Utilize techniques such as one-class SVM or isolation forest to detect and classify the minority class instances as anomalies.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Data Augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the minority class by introducing variations or transformations to existing samples. This helps to generate additional examples for the minority class, reducing the class imbalance.\n",
